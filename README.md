### Design Notes

This site was built with `yarn create react-app` to reduce web app set up time.<br>
I added the following packages:<br>
⋅⋅*axios - makes easy API calls
⋅⋅*react-ga - tracking user clicks with Google Analytics
⋅⋅*material-ui - reusuable web components that would expediate css and grid decision making
